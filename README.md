<p>  
With the exception of a few rare times, such as the Covid-19 phase, tourism has grown rapidly in the last decade. Tourism has the potential to expand in the near future. The tourist industry has shown to be a sector with tremendous growth potential in good times. Furthermore, when tourism activities expand, the country's economic status improves as well. As a result, governments frequently attempt to upgrade tourism-related infrastructure in order to attract visitors to the location (Tan et al., 2017). Tourism employs one out of every eleven people on the planet. It also demands for the world's service exports to account for 30% of total global exports.
Between 2013 and 2014, tourism-related data increased by 0.035 billion, from 1.087 billion to 1.122 billion, and this amount is predicted to climb to 1.8 billion by the end of 2030. (UNWTO, 2015). As a result, increasing the focus on tourist development in order to attract more visitors has become important.
The tourist industry's development and expansion is influenced by a number of variables. The tourism location environment, the presence of transit facilities, the geographical location, and accessibility to other tourist attractions in the area are only a few of these considerations. In addition, the attitudes of visitors and how they view a tourist destination influence the destination's success and growth (Camilleri, 2018). As a result, these elements must be effectively controlled in order for the country's tourism to thrive.</p>

❉Our website was created with the intention of addressing these issues.
